    <img src="<?php echo Yii::app()->request->baseUrl; ?>/images/thumpost.jpg" alt="Up water intake" class="imgfl" />
<p>Many people feel that they are pretty consistent with their workout regimen but find that their body is not getting any fitter. It can be frustrating especially if you are putting in time at the gym but your shape doesn’t look any different from what it did before. This can be a little de-motivating and a definite deterrent on your path to fitness and health. </p>
      <p>The good news is that it generally doesn’t take more than a few little tweaks to set you on the right path. So, if you find that your fitness levels are at a standstill, here are some tips that can get you going again:</p>
    <h3>Increase water intake </h3>
    <p>It’s a known fact that 60% of the human body is made up of water. If you are not guzzling on a sufficient amount of water, you will not be able to workout at optimum levels and you will get tired out faster. Another important fact is that the efficiency levels of your circulatory system and muscles will not be at their highest levels if you are not consuming enough water. </p>
    <p>Typically, women should consume at least 9 glasses of water per day and men will need at least 13 glassfuls. But don’t stop at that quantity if you feel dehydrated, have worked out or are moving around in the blazing heat. Generally, your body will tell you when it is needs a drink of water. Avoid sports/energy drinks as they have electrolytes but they are also packed with unnecessary calories.  </p>
    <h3>Food assessment</h3>

    <p>If you head for the gym every single day of the week, you still cannot take the liberty of eating in an unscrupulous manner. Watch what you eat and control the number of times you eat out. Don’t offset all your physical workout with additional calories- that way; you will only be back to square1. Carry protein bars or some fruit to work and munch on those when you feel the hunger pangs taking hold. </p>
    <p>Go easy on salty foods as excess of sodium leads to water retention. Keep refined sugar at an arm’s length as most foods like fruits, nuts, vegetables and seeds have natural sugars that your body needs. Stay away from refined flour-products and opt for whole-grain flour instead. </p>
    <h3>Interval training</h3>
    <p>If you have been consistent with a certain exercise routine and not seen sufficient results, it’s time to switch your routine a bit and push yourself a little further. The human body has the ability to adapt to any regular workout routine. When you perform the same actions time and again, you will find that gains are on the decline. Include interval training into your exercise training. Alternate the intensity of your exercise and keep your body guessing about what is coming next. </p>
    <p>This will give you continuous and consistent results. Maybe that’s its way of telling you that it too needs some variety.</p>
    <h3>Weight training</h3>

    <p>You do not have to turn into a body builder and pump weights like there is no tomorrow, but include some form of weight training in your exercise routine. It will help in keeping your muscle toned. Maintaining muscle also requires that your body burn calories and you end up losing excess weight. Intersperse your regular workout with 2-3 weight training sessions per week and see the difference it makes. </p>
    <p>There are people who lift weights but find that it has not helped them in any way. Getting maximum gains from any workout is about following the right technique and this is something that only a professional will be able to help you with. Hire the services of a professional physical coach via gympik.com. The person will help you understand which exercise and weight training methods are the best for you.</p>

You can also use the planning/measuring/tracking functionality on this amazing website to ensure that you are doing everything right and getting the results you desire. Everyone’s body reacts differently.</p>
      
    <P>Very importantly, allow your muscles the rest period they need and ensure that you do not over-stress them in a bid to be fit. Remember that fitness is not something that can be achieved in a day or even a week. It’s a lifelong commitment to your body and health and also a way of living. Try a mix and match of various things that we have discussed and before long you will be see the inches melting away and the pounds vanishing into oblivion. </p>
