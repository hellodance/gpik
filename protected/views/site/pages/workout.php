      <img class="imgfl" src="<?php echo Yii::app()->request->baseUrl; ?>/images/workout_011.jpg" alt="" />
<p>Fitness, health, nutrition, exercise, diet, physical training, gymming, cardiovascular exercise- are all pieces of a jigsaw puzzle that can end up leaving you puzzled. The trick lies in paying due attention to all these pieces and seeing whether they fit in into your lifestyle and can complete the broader picture of health and overall wellbeing. </p>
      <p>There is no dearth of activities when it comes to maintaining your fitness levels and you should follow a regimen that will leave you feeling invigorated, relaxed and peaceful (depending on what form of exercise you have completed). You can take up activities like yoga, tai-chi, aerobics, swimming, jogging, or even work out at a gym. The activity you choose will be dependent on various factors. When it comes to fitness, you need to remove those blinkers and take a 360 degree view of health before you settle upon any routine.<br />

      <h3 class="green">Get Set before You say Go</h3> <img src="<?php echo Yii::app()->request->baseUrl; ?>/images/workout_022.jpg" alt=""  class="img11"/>     
      <p>You can take the help of a personal trainer/coach to help you set a workout routine but if you have chosen to strike out on the path to good health without professional help, every bit of advice you get can prove to be helpful. Its time you set out putting together an exercise program. A piece of warning here- over-ambitious workout routines can be like a damp firecracker- They will burn brightly at the outset and fizzle out even before you can say boom. </p>

      <p>If you are uninitiated when it comes to working-out, sit down and chalk out a workout guide or a program for yourself. The one way to tilt the scale in your favour is to consider some of these basic points before you say get-set-go:</p>
      

<ul class="details">
<li><p><strong>Current Fitness Levels-</strong> Like many people you know, if you have been a couch potato for some time, not only is it unrealistic, but dangerous as well, to strap on your jogging shoes and attempt a 5-mile run the first time around. Try not to be a weekend warrior as that will only leave you weakened not only physically but in spirit as well. Your sore muscles will groan and say- ‘no more’ and you will buckle and give up. </p>
<p>If you push yourself too hard at the outset, you might even end up tearing a ligament or injuring yourself in some other way. An injury is a sure-shot way of sabotaging your own exercise program. Play it smart, listen to your body and ramp up your program gradually and steadily. One step at a time- those rippling muscles and optimum fitness levels will be yours for sure but not overnight. </p>
<p>Start slowly, because moderate exercise will not damage your intentions or your physique. If you suffer from any ailment or have previous injuries, consult your physician about your physical limitations and get some good advice. Ask for a well-rounded exercise program that has been customized to your specific needs.</p>
</li>
<li><p><strong>Exercise Goals-</strong> Ideally, your exercise program should be a mix of aerobic and strength-training exercises. Depending on your goals, you might want to target specific areas. For instance, if your goal is weight-loss, shine the spotlight on calorie-burning aerobic exercise. If balance and flexibility are your primary concerns, try spending some time on Tai-chi and yoga. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Like/Dislike- </strong>You should like the program you follow. If you hate swimming, there is no way you will be able to sustain a swimming program, regardless of how good it actually is for you. However, if you love walking or dancing, you might find it simpler to stick with an exercise plan that is built around activities like these. When you are starting out, do not expect to change all your likes and dislikes. For the moment, go with the flow and very slowly but surely – you will know, whether a change of path is something you would like to try. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Setting-</strong> This is a very important factor and many people tend to overlook it. Even if you love swimming, having no easy access to a pool can be a definite problem. Similarly, if you reside in a particularly cold or hot climate, it might not be possible for you to sustain certain outdoor activities.</p><p>However, if there are any good jogging parks/ open areas in the vicinity of your home, a quick morning/evening run might be the right ticket. Also, never give up any opportunity to walk- up or down stairs, run errands or walk to the post office or local provision store. Try to keep those hamstrings well-acquainted with want they are meant to do. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>The Lone Rider? -</strong> Depending on your personality, you might want to exercise either with other people or by yourself. Many people prefer the solitude that running or swimming offers them. They use it as a spot of quietitude to contemplate or plan their day. On the other hand, there are people who enjoy the support and motivation that a group aerobics session offers. Some might also prefer walking with someone. </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Money Matters- </strong>Not everyone has the luxury of spending in an unbridled manner on exercise and fancy gyms. You will have to weigh expense against all the other factors that we have talked about above. You will find a variety of exercise options in a range of prices. If you prefer not to spend too much on your workout program, consider running, jogging or walking. </p>
<p>All you will have to invest in is a pair of good running shoes. If you like gymming but are concerned about the cost of the membership, buy a couple of sets of dumbbells and barbells. It’s a one-time investment and you can work-out at in your home, at your convenience. </p>
<p>However, there are some who feel that the money that is spent on a gym membership in itself is a motivating factor to get them on their feet. There is no hard-and-fast rule about what will work and what will not. It’s subjective to a person’s circumstances, personality and likes and dislikes. </p></li>

</ul>

<p>And so, when you chalk out a workout guide for yourself, take all these factors into consideration. Very importantly, be considerate to your body. Allocate some time everyday or at least 3 times a week for exercise, set achievable goals, stay focused, be in touch with your mind and body, proceed steadily and with deliberation.   </p>
<p>Even after you have started on a particular exercise routine, consider how you actually feel, psychologically and physically, before, during and post your workout (all forms of exercises included). Be flexible enough to mix-and-match and alter your routine. Be like a blade of grass- willing and able to withstand storms and still stand tall. That is what persistence and resilience is all about- and persistence is the backbone of maintaining good health.
