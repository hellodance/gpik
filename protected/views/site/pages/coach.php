    	<h3 class="green">Choosing the Right Coach is the Right Approach to a Fitness Program<img class="imgfl" src="<?php echo Yii::app()->request->baseUrl; ?>/images/home-gym_001.jpg" alt="" /></h3>
   	<p>Physical fitness and health is not just about running on the treadmill till your lungs burst or lifting weights till your muscles groan. Yes, of course there is some truth in the saying- “No pain, no gain” but many of us take this too literally. Being fit is about approaching exercise in a revolutionary manner and taking a holistic view is important. </p>
      <p>Many of us have an urge to embark upon the path of fitness and many must have also tried different forms of exercise at one point or the other. Since you are reading this, it also means that your mind is set and you know you need to pull yourself out the pit of inactivity that you have been wallowing in, but just can’t seem to find the right moment to do it. 
      </p>

      
      <h3 class="green">Fitness Vs Health</h3>      
      <p>The first thing to understand at this point is that gymming is not necessarily synonymous with fitness. There are various ways in which you can work out and maintain optimum fitness levels. You can choose to workout at a gym, alternatively you can involve yourself in any sports activity, yoga, martial arts, Pilates, parkour and Tai-chi, just to name a few. The fitness regime you take up should be dependent on your personality, personal likes, physical limitations, age and medical conditions.  </p>
<h3 class="green">The Right Choice</h3><img src="<?php echo Yii::app()->request->baseUrl; ?>/images/right-choice_111.jpg" alt=""  class="img11"/>  
      <p>If you like the power-quotient, vibrancy and ambience of a gym, then gymming is for you. On the other hand, if you prefer more action in your workout, you should opt for any sports that involve some kind of aerobic activity. Swimming and jogging or lawn tennis are excellent options. If you prefer a more calming workout- try yoga or Tai-chi and you will be happy with your workout every day.  </p>
      
<p>Regardless of which form of exercise routine you decide to take up, you will need someone experienced to guide you. Taking the help of a professional trainer will help you get off on the right foot and achieve your fitness goals faster. The minute you hear the word trainer, it conjures images of dumbbells and pulleys and a taskmaster who is urging you to go through that one extra push-up- but is that what you really need? </p>
<h3 class="green">Find a Coach </h3>      
      <p>Not really, what any person who is looking for overall fitness and health needs, is a fitness coach who will help you gear up mentally and physically and give you specific training and pointers about what you can do to be a fitter version of yourself. At this point you may wonder what the difference between a fitness trainer and a coach is. Truth is there is a world of difference. A trainer might be able to get you onto the path of fitness and help you build those 6 packs you always wanted, but a fitness coach is much more than that.</p>
<h3 class="green">The Coach Approach</h3>
<p>A coach will not only help you get into shape, he/she will also help you control your state of consciousness and understand the synergy between fitness thought and an actual physical workout.  The person will be able to judge your capacity and help you establish new limits. </p>
<p>The one way to total fitness and health is through understanding how your body reacts to a food and exercise regimen that will help you maximize your potential almost instantaneously. What needs to be eliminated is the factor of under-training and over-training. Maintaining equilibrium and training correctly and consciously is what a fitness coach will help you do. </p>
<p>If you are mentally ready to embark upon a fitness program, irrespective of what form of exercise you have chosen, finding the right fitness coach is all important to your goal. Let’s see what you need to look for before you hire a coach. </p><img src="<?php echo Yii::app()->request->baseUrl; ?>/images/right-choice2.jpg" alt=""  class="imgfl"/> 
<p><strong>#1: Check their physique-</strong> the basic pre-requisite should be that your fitness coach be in shape. Why would you want to hire a personal trainer who wasn’t fit himself/herself? It would be like learning about wine tasting from a tee-totaller. If the coach is not in shape there is one of 2 things going on. Either the person’s advice is no good or the person is not able to motivate himself. Either ways, this is a person you will want to bypass and look for a trainer who follows his own advice and can help you get results.   </p>
<p><strong>#2: The personality factor-</strong> regardless of how experienced and famous the fitness coach is, if there is no synergy between your personalities it will not help you in any way. You need to like the person who is going to be your health guide. Try to watch them while they are interacting with any of their current clients, meet them a few times and see if the person is someone you can synch with before you hire them. </p>
<p><strong>#3: Motivation matters-</strong> always keep in mind, that a coach/trainer’s business in not only to teach and train you, but to motivate you and the person must be very forthcoming about how they actually do it. Some could be the drill sergeant type (as if they have just stepped out of the military), while others might prefer to adopt a gentler route.  The important thing is to be honest about what style works for you to get the best results. </p>
<p><strong>#4: Ask about credentials-</strong> Apart from personality and the motivational style, you have to ensure that the fitness coach you hire knows what he/she is doing. That is the basic idea of hiring a professional. The person should be able to able to show you the necessary credentials. Education, training and experience are as important in the fitness field as they are in any other.  And so, if you are hiring someone to train you on yoga, the person should have the necessary credentials. You don’t want to end up with twisted sinews and over-stressed lungs now, do you? </p>
<p><strong>#5: Ask for referrals- </strong>In India, there are some things we shy away from as a matter of culture. When we get medication from a doctor for some common ailments, very few of us actually ask how the white tablet helps or what the multi-colored one is for. Sure you trust the doctor, but knowing is important as well. Similarly, never shy away from asking for referrals. If a fitness coach is really worth his mettle, past and current clients should have no qualms about singing their praises. That is one way of knowing whether you are hiring the right person and not a scam trainer. </p>
	<h3 class="green">To Fitness and Health</h3>
    <p>Being on the right path is a lot about stepping on the right stones and navigating past all the possible potholes. Do not be in a hurry to hire a trainer, run them through the test and see what suits you the best. Look for person who will be able to provide you with inspiration, motivation, information and guidance. After all, it’s your health and well-being, (not to mention- money) that is at stake here. Choose the right fitness coach, exercise wisely and stay healthy!</p>
