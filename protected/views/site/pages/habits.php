    	<h3>Healthy Eating Habits for Children</h3>
    <img src="<?php echo Yii::app()->request->baseUrl; ?>/images/eat_habit_1.jpg" alt="healthy eat habit" class="imgfl" width="338" />
<p>Childhood is the time to instil lifelong eating and exercise habits that contribute to good health. Nutrition affects children’s ability to learn, develop and stay healthy throughout life. Getting children to develop healthy eating habits is about as easy as herding cats. It’s been often asked why is it that everything that is good for you tastes bad, yet everything that is bad for you tastes good. Even if you have the answer, try explaining it to a 6 year old. </p>
      <p>Feeding your child a nutritious meal is a challenge to most parents. Sometimes, parents would be successful in feeding their child the right quantity of food. Infants and pre-school children are extremely vulnerable and succumb when the diet is poor in quality and quantity.</p>
      <p>Family, environment, social trends, media, peer pressure and illness or disease affect the food habits of your child. Parents are equally responsible for children's eating habits and table manners. By teaching your child healthy eating habits, and modelling these behaviours in yourself, you can help your child maintain a healthy weight and normal growth. Also, the eating habits your child pick up when they are young will help them maintain a healthy lifestyle when they are adults.</p>

    <h3>Some approaches that parents can take to develop healthy eating habits in their children are -</h3>
    
    <ul style ="list-style:disc;display: list-item"><li style ="list-style:disc;display: list-item">
            Do not let your child watch TV during meals. Talk about something interesting that will increase your child's general knowledge or you may even talk about their day at school. Watching television with multiple media cues to eat is considered as a factor in excessive weight gain for children especially in age group of six to seven years.
        </li>
        <li style ="list-style:disc;display: list-item">
            Children like to try out different food. Parents should offer a variety of foods including their child’s favourites. They can also try substitutions within the same food group. 
        </li>
        <li style ="list-style:disc;display: list-item">
           Pre-school children do best with small servings of food offered several times a day because of their smaller capacity and variable appetites.
        </li>
        <li style ="list-style:disc;display: list-item">
           Most children eat four to six times a day, which means snacks should be chosen carefully so that it is dense in nutrients and not limited to biscuits, chips, crisps, colas, chocolates and pastries.
        </li>
        <li style ="list-style:disc;display: list-item">
           Parents can include wholesome snacks like fresh fruits, cheese, raw vegetable sticks, milk, fruit juices, whole grain and gram products and sandwiches.
        </li>
        <li style ="list-style:disc;display: list-item">
           Avoid giving any food or drink within 1½ hours of a meal to your child. It does not take much to satisfy a child's appetite but even small snacks may result in poor eating at meal time.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
