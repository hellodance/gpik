			<strong>Aim for a fitter, healthier YOU! </strong></p>
		
		<p>
			Life in the fast lane can be addictive and heady. It gives you a rush and you get used to the jostle and rushing around. City travel and hectic work schedules leave you sapped of energy and at the end of every work day you feel like you have spent more than enough calories and that you had all the exercises you need. Sure, all the energy has been wrung out of you and you feel that you have done your bit towards maintaining fitness. But the fact is, very little calories have been spent and your fitness levels are lower than higher. Adding fuel to the fire is all the junk food you ply your body with. Many of us know that good health is about eating right and exercising right but just don’t know how to do it.</p>

			<strong>The Gympik Story so Far!</strong></p>
		
		<p>
			The Gympik backdrop - Two health freaks Amaresh and Ajay (co-founders) - sweating it out at the gym get talking, sharing experiences and health concepts. They were talking about how exasperating and challenging it can be to zero-in on the right personal trainers. The chance meeting between these two dynamic individuals turned into a camaraderie and one day, between barbell repetitions a germ of an idea took root. The idea that was to grow into the movement is now called Gympik.</p>
		
		<p>
			Apart from the common thread of interest they share in health and fitness, between the two of them, Amaresh and Ajay have years of experience in the technical domain, product engineering, marketing and sales. This experience is the perfect support backdrop to solve real-time business needs. Gympik is their attempt to help you accelerate your own envelope, control your results and create an experience of your own on the path of picture perfect Gympik health.</p>
